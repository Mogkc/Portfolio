          I am a programmer, an instructor, a hobby writer, and an Eagle Scout. 
          Because thinking clearly is a core value to me, I aim to be clear and concise at all times.
          Discovering concise wording forces well-formed thoughts.
          This focus on clear communication improves my abilities as an instructor and a programmer.

          My joy in finding repeatable, reusable solutions makes back-end development very appealing to me.
          I completed a Programming Bootcamp from UCSD to turn my college-level C++ and Java into a multi-language web toolset.
          Doing Quality Assurance Engineering at Human Care Systems, I automated laborious tasks in addition to implementing a testing framework.
          Automating monotonous tasks, such as quality assurance, is vital to prevent mistakes from impacting clients.
